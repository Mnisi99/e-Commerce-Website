A simple responsive e-commerce website demo (static front-end) containing an example product layout and responsive stylesheet.

## What this repository contains

- `responsive_page.html` — the main demo page to open in a browser.
- `responsive.css` — stylesheet with responsive rules used by the demo.
- `images/` — folder for product and site images used by the demo.
